# long spinner

<!-- Short description of what your project does(3-4 senetnces)-->
This is a small project that is designed to be used as a loading screen. This project displays the same animation as I used from the previous loading screen I created.  

## Technologies

<!-- Technologies you used -->
- HTML

## The Process

<!-- The process of how I build it -->
The same animation I used from the previous project only this time I adjusted the height and width of the spinner bar. The purpose of me doing this was to have the ability of using work I have done previously and refreance them in the future for other projects I can create. This project was created using **Visual Studio**. 

## Running the project

<!-- How others can access your project and allow them to run it -->
1. Select the long_spinner.html
2. Inside the **code** section your looking for an icon on the right side that should say **"Download raw file"**.
3. Once the html is downloaded you can run it inside your IDE or code editor.
